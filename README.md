### Description

It is a great visual tutorial to learn about Databases in Visual Basic.

This is the part I because i couldn't upload the zip file. Please download part II at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=44042&lngWId=1.

This is not a simple tutorial, it have steps by step and with every step have a photoscreen to guide you

With it you can learn:

- How to link an Access database to VB

- How to view the database in labels

- How to create, delete and edit the differents register

- How to make a filter (search engine) of strings, number and Dates

- How to resolve common problems with DB

- How to show the database in a sheet like Excel (Datagrid control)

- How you can manipulate the DB with the Ado Control invisible

- How to specify a format for a type of data like "$ 23.80" or "23/sep/2003"

- and much more...

Also have a very good example divided in VB in three parts:

1- View, add and edit DB

2- Find in DB

3- Non visible Ado Control with Datagrid control

I recomend it for beginner or newbies in DB and also for that who want to make better
